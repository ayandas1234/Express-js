a route handler for GET requests to "/index". When a request is made to "/index", the server logs a message to the console and sends an HTML file (named index.html) as the response --->>>

1.) app.get("/index", (req, res) => { ... }):

This sets up a GET route at the path "/index".

app.get() is used specifically for handling GET requests.

"/index" is the URL endpoint, meaning when a user navigates to http://your-server-address/index, this function will handle that request.

(req, res) => { ... } is a callback function with two parameters:

req: The request object, containing information about the clientâ€™s request.

res: The response object, used to send a response back to the client.

2.) console.log("Hey its index");:

Logs "Hey its index" to the server console whenever this route is accessed. This can be helpful for debugging or confirming that the route is being reached.


3.) res.sendFile('templates/index.html', { root: __dirname });:

res.sendFile() is used to send a file as the response to the client.

'templates/index.html' specifies the path to the file you want to send. Here, the file is located in a directory named templates in the project root.

{ root: __dirname } is an option that sets the root directory for relative file paths.

__dirname is a Node.js global variable representing the directory in which the current script is located.
