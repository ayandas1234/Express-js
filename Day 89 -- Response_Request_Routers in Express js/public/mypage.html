<!--
let a = await fetch("/", { method: "POST" });:

This line sends a POST request to the root URL ("/").

fetch() is used to make network requests. Here, it is set with { method: "POST" }, specifying that this is a POST request (as opposed to the default GET).

await pauses the execution of the function until the fetch() promise is resolved, meaning it waits for the server to respond. 
 -->


<!--
 let b = await a.text();:

This line waits for the response (a) to be converted to text format.

a.text() is used to retrieve the body of the response as plain text.

await ensures that b receives the response text only after it is fully available.
-->


<!-- A POST request is used to send data to a web server, typically for storage. Some common uses include:- Form submissions , File uploads , API interactions , Resource creation or update

A PUT request is an HTTP method used to update or replace a resource on a server. It's used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.

The DELETE request method is used to remove a resource from a server.
